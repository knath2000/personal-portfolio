# Product Context

Why: Showcase skills through an interactive, game-like experience aligned with modern Apple-style glass aesthetics.
Problems solved: Static portfolios feel dated; this emphasizes interaction and technical depth with graceful low-spec fallback.
How it should work: Hero card over animated 3D background, smooth motion, accessible, responsive, and performant on older devices.
UX goals: Delightful visuals, fast interactions, low cognitive load, motion-respectful, keyboard accessible.
